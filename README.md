# Naughts and Crosses Q-Learning
## Premise
This is a simple python project I used to experimient with the Q-Learning.

The computer learns by creating a state table, and from each game/board position, taking the move which maximise benefits.

The computer has one other option, this is to instead explore other options in an attempt to find a better choice. 

The game implementation could use some optimising, this was an early python experiment.
